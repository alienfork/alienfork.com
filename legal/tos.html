        <p class="muted">Last updated: August 15, 2025</p>

        <p>By accessing or using Alien Fork products or services (“Services”), you agree to these Terms. You must be at
            least 13 years old (or the age of majority in your region) to use our Services. If you purchase our games
            through a third-party platform (such as Steam or itch.io), their terms and policies also apply. You may not
            misuse the Services, including attempting to cheat, interfere with servers, bypass security, or infringe on
            any intellectual property rights.</p>

        <p>Purchases are processed by our payment partners. Prices, features, and availability are subject to change.
            Taxes will be added where applicable. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms. If
            our Services include online features or user-generated content, you are responsible for your activity and
            content. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
            BY LAW.</p>

        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time; continued use of the Services after changes take effect
            constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. These Terms are governed by the laws of Delaware, USA. Disputes
            will be resolved in courts located in Delaware, unless required otherwise by law. If any provision is
            unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</p>
