        <p class="muted">Last updated: August 15, 2025</p>

        <p>For digital goods purchased directly from us, refund requests are considered within 14 days of purchase if
            the game has not been substantially played. A game is considered substantially played if more than 2 hours
            of gameplay have been logged or if it has been launched more than once. For subscriptions, you can cancel
            anytime; cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period.</p>

        <p>If you purchased our games through a third-party platform (such as Steam, itch.io, or any console
            marketplace), refund requests must follow that platform’s refund process and policies, including their
            timelines. We cannot process those refunds directly.</p>

        <p>To request a refund for a direct purchase, email <a
                href="mailto:support@alienfork.com">support@alienfork.com</a> with your order email, receipt ID, and
            reason. Approved refunds are returned to the original payment method. We reserve the right to refuse a
            refund if we believe the request is fraudulent or abusive.</p>
